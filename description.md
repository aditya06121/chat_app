## Web Socket Protocol
**The WebSocket protocol is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It is designed to enable real-time, two-way interactions between clients (like web browsers) and servers.**

## Web socket server

A WebSocket server is a server that uses the WebSocket protocol to enable real-time, two-way communication between clients and the server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which are one-way and stateless, WebSocket allows for persistent connections, enabling data to flow freely in both directions.

Key Features of WebSocket Servers:
- Real-Time Communication: WebSocket enables instant data exchange, making it ideal for applications like chat apps, online gaming, and live notifications.

- Persistent Connection: Once a WebSocket connection is established, it remains open, allowing for continuous data exchange without needing to re-establish the connection.

- Low Latency: WebSockets reduce the overhead of HTTP headers, resulting in faster communication compared to traditional polling methods.

- Scalability: WebSocket servers can handle many concurrent connections, making them suitable for high-traffic applications.
